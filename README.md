# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is the final version of the Rock Paper Scissors assignment of The Odin Project. This version does not contain much html and has no CSS. This version allows the player to play
5 rounds of rock paper scissors on the browser console. Each turn taken, the player is notified of the results of the turn until 5 rounds have passed. After this happens, the total
wins are aggregated and the player is notified if he is a winner or a loser.

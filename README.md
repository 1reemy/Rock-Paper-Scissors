# Rock Paper Scissors.
This is the final version of the Rock Paper Scissors assignment of The Odin Project, which I have renamed 5 Shot K.O. This version is playable on the browser and features a GUI which is more user friendly. The game is a conventional Rock, Paper, Scissors battle between the user and the computer. The user selects the image representations of the rock paper or scissors all while the computer randomly selects either one of those selections. The player does this for five shots while the scoreboard at the top of the screen keeps score of the number of shots won by both the user and the computer. The first player to reach five successful shots is deemed the winner, this is displayed by a prompt announcing the winner and asking the user if they wish to continue playing. If the answer is 'OK' then the game resets and the user is able to play another round of 5 shots. If the answer is 'Cancel', then the game ends there and the total score is displayed.
